# Installation

OdinEye is a <b>server side</b> plugin that can be installed on Valheim dedicated servers.

## Requirements

- An instance of Valheim dedicated game server up and running (under Windows or Linux)
- [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) installed on the game server (version [5.4.22](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.22) is recommended)
- Access to the server file system (with a `FTP` client or similar tools provided by hosting services)

## Deploying plugin files

Download the plugins files from the latest release.  
Copy all the `*.dll` files into the server's BepInEx plugins folder located at `Valheim/BepInEx/plugins`

## Dry run and configuration

Start the dedicated server instance.  
OdinEye will generate a configuration file at `Valheim/BepInEx/config` named `org.bepinex.plugins.odineye.cfg`.  
Open the configuration file: 

```cfg title="/Valheim/BepInEx/config/org.bepinex.plugins.odineye.cfg"
## Settings file was created by plugin odineye v0.0.1.0
## Plugin GUID: org.bepinex.plugins.odineye

[Hosting]

## The network address where the Http Server will be hosted
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 
HttpServerAddress =
```

Provide a value for the `HttpServerAddress` field. Example: `http://yourserver.com:21618`


:::info[Remarks]
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="address" label="Server Address">
    The `HttpServerAddress` accepts addresses from different hosting models:
    - Server hosted on a external provider (online hosting service)
    - Server hosted on local/own infrastructure

    :warning: This property is experimental and is likely to be deprecated in future releases.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="port" label="Port">
    When using an external hosting provider, confirm that the designated port is open and available.  
    Note: the port should be different than the game server port (default `2456`) and Steam query port (default `2457`).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

Save the changes made to the configuration file and restart the dedicated server instance.

## Validation

Upon restarting, check the BepInEx logs for the presence of the following lines:  

```shell
[Message:   BepInEx] Preloader started
[Info   :   BepInEx] Loaded 1 patcher method from [BepInEx.Preloader 5.4.22.0]
[Info   :   BepInEx] 1 patcher plugin loaded

[Info   :   odineye] Starting Http Server at ...
[Info   :   odineye] OdinEye running!
// highlight-end
[Message:   BepInEx] Chainloader startup complete
```

Locating these lines confirms successful installation of the plugin.
