# Introduction

The OdinEye API is a set of HTTP endpoints that provide support for integrations with a Valheim game server. For example, the API can be used to query the current online players, track boss progression or understand the current in-game day and day cycles.  
The API is organized around REST: it accepts and returns JSON-encoded requests/responses, uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
Each REST API endpoint is documented individually, and the endpoints are categorized by the resource that they primarily affect.

## Base URL

All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

When making API calls, the base URL (including the port) should be changed accordingly, matching the <b>domain</b> that is being used for the game server and the <b>port</b> where OdinEye is running.

## Authentication

:::note
Authentication has not been implemented at this time.
:::

Upon implementation, the API will utilize [API Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_key) as the default authentication method. Subsequently, this documentation will be revised to include the necessary instructions.

## Requests

Making a API request involves combining the standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc) with the URL to the API, the URI to a resource, along with one or more HTTP request headers.

```curl showLineNumbers
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/v1/players' \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```

## Responses

API requests return HTTP status codes. These requests may also return JSON response bodies that include information about the resource.

### Successful requests

Commonly used HTTP codes:

| Status code      | Description                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200` Ok         | The request succeeded.                                             |
| `201` Created    | The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. |
| `204` No content | There is no content to send for this request.                      |


### Failed requests

Commonly used HTTP codes:

| Status code                 | Description                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400` Bad request           | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error. |
| `401` Unauthorized          | The client is not authenticated.                                                                           |
| `403` Forbidden             | The client does not have access rights to the content.                                                     |
| `404` Not found             | The server cannot find the requested resource.                                                             |
| `500` Internal server error | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.                                     |


:::note
Error handling has not been implemented at this time.
:::

Upon implementation, the API will utilize [Problem Details (RFC-9457)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) as the default format for error responses.  
Example:

```json
{
  "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400
}
```

## Versioning

The OdinEye API is versioned with a single number included in the URL of the API endpoint (`v1`). This number symbolizes the major version number.  
Any breaking changes made to the API will lead to an increase in the API version and a subsequent release. Breaking changes are changes that can potentially break an integration.
